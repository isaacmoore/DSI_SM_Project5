### Overview

This week, you've learned about access and utilizing remote databases, and more advanced topics for conducting logistic regression. Now, let's put these skills to the test!

You're working as a data scientist with a research firm that specializes in emergency management. In advance of client work, you've been asked to create and train a logistic regression model that can show off the firm's capabilities in disaster analysis.

Frequently after a disaster, researchers and firms will come in to give an independent review of an incident. While your firm doesn't have any current client data that it can share with you so that you may test and deploy your model, it does have data from the 1912 titanic disaster that it has stored in a remote database.

In this project, we'll be using data on passengers from the Titanic disaster to show off your analytical capabilities. The data is stored in a remote database, so you'll need to set up a connection and query the database (using Python!). After, you'll construct a logistic regression model and test/validate it's results so that it will be ready to deploy with a client.
